        <h1>Waste Segregation Guide</h1>
        
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>This app helps students and young workers sort household waste correctly. 
        By learning which bin each item belongs to, we can all contribute to a cleaner environment.</p>
        
        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>Proper waste segregation reduces landfill waste, increases recycling rates, 
        and helps protect our environment. When waste is sorted correctly, materials 
        like plastic, glass, and metal can be recycled into new products.</p>
        
        <h2>UN Sustainable Development Goal</h2>
        <p>This project supports UN SDG Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. 
        By making informed choices about waste disposal, we can reduce our environmental 
        impact and move towards a more sustainable future.</p>
